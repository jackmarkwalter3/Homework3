# Random Password Generator

This is a random password generator that I created. You can select what types of characters you would like to include in your password as well as the number of characters you would like to use for your password.

To generate a password, you click on the "Generate Password" button. You then can copy the password to your clipboard by clicking on the "Copy to Clipboard" button.
